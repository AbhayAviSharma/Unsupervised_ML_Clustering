# Summary:

Our project revolves around analyzing a comprehensive dataset of TV shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019, sourced from Flixable, a third-party Netflix search engine. Notably, Flixable's 2018 report highlighted a significant trend: the exponential growth of TV shows on Netflix since 2010, contrasting with a substantial decline in the number of movies available. In this project, we aim to delve deeper into this dataset, uncovering intriguing insights and trends, ultimately providing a broader perspective on the evolving content landscape of the world's leading streaming service.
Ultimately, this project aspires to provide Netflix with valuable insights into content distribution, viewer preferences, and the evolving landscape of its streaming service. By accomplishing these objectives, we aim to offer actionable recommendations and inform strategic decisions to cater to the ever-changing demands of Netflix subscribers.

# Conclusion:
In our project, we embarked on a comprehensive analysis of a vast dataset of content available on Netflix as of 2019. The data, sourced from Flixable, unveiled significant trends within the Netflix content like, how majority of content on Netflix is Movie based, how Netflix's popularity has leaped after 2015, finding top actors, favourite genres people like, average movies lasting 90-100 minutes, viewers preferring content to be binge watched, how US has most amount of content on the platform and much more.
The journey started with exploring our dataset, then went on to data analysis, data wrangling, data visualization. Further by employing advanced data preprocessing and feature engineering, we harnessed machine learning techniques, including K-Means clustering to uncover hidden patterns and grouping content into clusters. This allowed us to develop a recommendation system, which is based on the input of a content title, providing tailored suggestions for similar content to watch.
The project not only delivers valuable insights into content distribution and viewer preferences but also equips Netflix with actionable recommendations to adapt and cater to the ever-evolving demands of its subscribers. By exploring the dynamic landscape of the world's leading streaming service, we have paved the way for informed strategic decisions in a rapidly evolving digital entertainment industry.

# Applications:
Content curation and Recommendation enhancing user engagement.
Analyzing trends will help in making informed choices in production and Content Acquisition.
Data driven decision making, improving customer satisfaction.
Subscriber Retention through continuosly adapting to viewer preferences.
Competition analysis, Marketing and Promotion and much more.
Resulting in Subscriber growth, Reduced churn rates, optimized content investment, improved content monetization, enhanced viewer engagement etc. which demonstrates the potential for data driven decision making to drive success in the online streaming industry.
